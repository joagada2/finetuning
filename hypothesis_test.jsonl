{"background": "Designing efficient, metal free, and in-expensive catalyst for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial for large scale clean and green energy production. Recently synthesized 1D Biphenylene nanoribbons (BPRs) display few exciting properties originating from the unique co-existence of 4, 6 and 8 coordinated carbon rings. Here, we present a first principles calculation of the electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity of various sized N-BPRs (N indicates the width).", "target": "The electronic properties are crucially sensitive to the width (N) of BPRs transiting it from semiconducting to metallic nature at N=18. The p$_z$ orbitals of C-atoms from the central tetragonal rings are mainly responsible for the decrease in band gap with increasing width. Gibbs free energy also depends sensitively on the width of BPRs as evident from the p-band center analysis. A close inspection of the elementary reactions of HER (Volmer, Heyrovsky and Tafel) confirms Volmer-Tafel mechanism to be most dominant on 15-BPR with Tafel as the rate-determining step with a barrier of 0.56 eV."}
{"background": "Nonlinear charge transport, such as nonreciprocal longitudinal resistance and nonlinear Hall effect, has attracted considerable interest in probing the symmetries and topological properties of new materials. Recent research has revealed significant nonreciprocal longitudinal resistance and nonlinear Hall effect in MnBi2Te4, an intrinsic magnetic topological insulator, induced by the quantum metric dipole. However, the inconsistent response with charge density and conflicting C3z symmetry requirement necessitate a thorough understanding of factors affecting the nonlinear transport measurement. This study uncovers an experimental factor leading to significant nonlinear transport signals in MnBi2Te4, attributed to gate voltage oscillation from the application of large alternating current.", "target": "Additionally, a methodology is proposed to suppress this effect by individually grounding the voltage electrodes during second-harmonic measurements."}
{"background": "We report on the first detailed beam test attesting the fundamental principle behind the development of high-current-efficiency ultrafast electron microscope systems where a radio-frequency cavity is incorporated as a condenser lens in the beam delivery system.", "target": "To allow the experiment to be carried out with a sufficient resolution to probe the performance at the emittance floor, a new cascade loop RF controller system is developed to reduce the RF noise floor. Temporal resolution at 50 femtoseconds in full-width-at-half-maximum and detection sensitivity better than 1% are demonstrated on exfoliated 1T-TaSe$_2$ layers where the multi-order edge-mode coherent phonon excitation is employed as the standard candle to benchmark the performance."}
{"background": "Tuning the thermal transport properties of hybrid halide perovskites is critical for their applications in optoelectronics, thermoelectrics, and photovoltaics. Here, we demonstrate an effective strategy to modulate the thermal transport property of hybrid perovskites by halide alloying.", "target": "A highly tunable thermal conductivity of mixed-halide hybrid perovskites is achieved due to halide-alloying and structural distortion. Our experimental measurements show that the room temperature thermal conductivity of MAPb(BrxI1-x)3 (x = 0-1) can be largely modulated from 0.27 W/mK (x = 0.5) to 0.47 W/mK (x = 1). Molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that the thermal conductivity reduction of hybrid halide perovskites results from the suppression of the mean free paths of the low-frequency acoustic and optical phonons. It is found that halide alloying and the induced structural distortion can largely increase the scatterings of optical and acoustic phonons, respectively. The confined diffusion of MA+ cations in the octahedra cage is found to act as an additional thermal transport channel in hybrid perovskites and can contribute around 10-20% of the total thermal conductivity."}
{"background": "Identifying relevant machine-learning features for multi-sensing platforms is both an applicative limitation to recognize environments and a necessity to interpret the physical relevance of transducers' complementarity in their information processing. Particularly for long acquisitions, feature extraction must be fully automatized without human intervention and resilient to perturbations without increasing significantly the computational cost of a classifier. In this study, we investigate on the relative resistance and current modulation of a 24-dimensional conductimetric electronic nose, which uses the exponential moving average as a floating reference in a low-cost information descriptor for environment recognition.", "target": "In particular, we identified that depending on the structure of a linear classifier, the'modema' descriptor is optimized for different material sensing elements' contributions to classify information patterns. The low-pass filtering optimization leads to opposite behaviors between unsupervised and supervised learning: the latter one favors longer integration of the reference, allowing to recognize five different classes over 90%, while the first one prefers using the latest events as its reference to clusterize patterns by environment nature."}
{"background": "The quantities required for the calculation are torque matrix elements, the real and imaginary parts of the Green's function and its derivatives. Here, we calculate these parameters for the elemental magnets such as Fe, Co and Ni in an ab initio framework using density functional theory and Wannier functions.", "target": "We also propose a method to calculate the torque matrix elements within the Wannier framework."}
{"background": "Deep learning for predicting the electronic-structure Hamiltonian of quantum systems necessitates satisfying the covariance laws, among which achieving SO(3)-equivariance without sacrificing the non-linear expressive capability of networks remains unsolved. To navigate the harmonization between equivariance and expressiveness, we propose a deep learning method synergizing two distinct categories of neural mechanisms as a two-stage encoding and regression framework.", "target": "The first stage corresponds to group theory-based neural mechanisms with inherent SO(3)-equivariant properties prior to the parameter learning process, while the second stage is characterized by a non-linear 3D graph Transformer network we propose, featuring high capability on non-linear expressiveness. The novel combination lies in the point that, the first stage predicts baseline Hamiltonians with abundant SO(3)-equivariant features extracted, assisting the second stage in empirical learning of equivariance; and in turn, the second stage refines the first stage's output as a fine-grained prediction of Hamiltonians using powerful non-linear neural mappings, compensating for the intrinsic weakness on non-linear expressiveness capability of mechanisms in the first stage. Our method enables precise, generalizable predictions while capturing SO(3)-equivariance under rotational transformations, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in Hamiltonian prediction on six benchmark databases."}
{"background": "Many properties of commonly used materials are driven by their microstructure, which can be influenced by the composition and manufacturing processes. To optimise future materials, understanding the microstructure is critically important. Here, we present two novel approaches based on artificial intelligence that allow the segmentation of the phases of a microstructure for which simple numerical approaches, such as thresholding, are not applicable:", "target": "One is based on the nnU-Net neural network, and the other on generative adversarial networks (GAN). Using large panoramic scanning electron microscopy images of dual-phase steels as a case study, we demonstrate how both methods effectively segment intricate microstructural details, including martensite, ferrite, and damage sites, for subsequent analysis. Either method shows substantial generalizability across a range of image sizes and conditions, including heat-treated microstructures with different phase configurations. The nnU-Net excels in mapping large image areas. Conversely, the GAN-based method performs reliably on smaller images, providing greater step-by-step control and flexibility over the segmentation process."}
{"background": "We demonstrate that ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) can be used for in situ studies of dynamic changes in surface chemistry in a plasma environment. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was used in this study as a model system since it exhibits a wide array of unique chemical, optical, and electrical properties that make it a prospective material for advanced electronics.", "target": "To better understand the stability and surface chemistry of h-BN during plasma-assisted processing, we used polycrystalline Cu foils with single-layer h-BN, grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and tracked in real-time the plasma-induced reduction of the underlying Cu oxide using APXPS equipped with 22 kHz 75 W discharge plasma source operating at 13 Pa. Residual gas analysis (RGA) mass-spectra were concurrently collected during plasma-XPS to track reaction products formed during plasma exposure. A clear reduction of CuxO is seen, while an h-BN layer remains intact, suggesting H radical species can attack the exposed and h-BN-covered Cu oxide patches and partially reduce the underlying substrate."}
{"background": "Orbital currents and accumulation provide a new avenue to boost spintronic effects in nanodevices.", "target": "Here we use interconversion effects between charge current and orbital angular momentum to demonstrate a dramatic increase in the magnon spin injection and detection efficiencies in nanodevices consisting of a magnetic insulator contacted by Pt/CuOx electrodes. Moreover, we note distinct variations in efficiency for magnon spin injection and detection, indicating a disparity in the direct and inverse orbital Rashba Edelstein effect efficiencies."}
{"background": "Recently, two monolayer magnetic materials, i.e., FePS3 and NiPS3, have been successfully fabricated. Despite that they have the same atomic structure, the two monolayers exhibit distinct magnetic properties. FePS3 holds an out-of-plane zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM-ZZ) structure, while NiPS3 exhibits an in-plane AFM-ZZ structure. However, there is no theoretical model which can properly describe its magnetic ground state due to the lack of a full understanding of its magnetic interactions. Here, by combining the first-principles calculations and the newly developed machine learning method, we construct an exact spin Hamiltonian of the two magnetic materials.", "target": "Different from the previous studies which failed to fully consider the spin-orbit coupling effect, we find that the AFM-ZZ ground state in FePS3 is stabilized by competing ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic third nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, and combining single-ion anisotropy. Whereas, the often ignored nearest-neighbor biquadratic exchange is responsible for the in-plane AFM-ZZ ground state in NiPS3. We additionally calculate spin-wave spectrum of AFM-ZZ structure in the two monolayers based on the exact spin Hamiltonian, which can be directly verified by the experimental investigation."}
{"background": "The bulk Ta2Pd3Te5 is a van der Waals (vdW) layered compound, whereas the vdW layer can be obtained through exfoliation or molecular-beam epitaxy.", "target": "By systematic theoretical calculations, we have revealed an excitonic insulator (EI) in the Ta2Pd3Te5 monolayer. First-principles calculations show that the monolayer is a nearly zero-gap semiconductor with the modified Becke-Johnson functional. Using the first-principles many-body perturbation theory, the GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation calculation reveals that the exciton binding energy is larger than the single-particle band gap, indicating the excitonic instability. The computed phonon spectrum suggests that the monolayer is dynamically stable without lattice distortion. Our findings suggest that the Ta2Pd3Te5 monolayer is an excitonic insulator without structural distortion."}
{"background": "Dislocation slip and deformation twin are widely regarded as two important mechanisms of active competition in the process of plastic deformation. Calculating and comparing the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) of two deformation modes are the key to discussing the mechanical properties reflected by different mechanisms in crystals. Here, the paper proposes a model to predict the CRSS of discrete twins, resembling thin layers, using the elastic anisotropy theory and a macroscopic energy perspective. In addition, the directionality of deformation twinning is also verified.", "target": "We investigated twinning in FCC crystals to illustrate the methodology, and predicted the CRSS of twinning under different variables such as temperature and strain rate, both of which were in excellent agreement with experimental and other theory results. It draws the conclusion that we can promote twinning nucleation by applying shear stress along the <112> direction to reduce the interface energy as a resistance term and increase the difference in strain energy for twinning nucleation."}
{"background": "Strain engineering has quickly emerged as a viable option to modify the electronic, optical and magnetic properties of 2D materials. However, it remains challenging to arbitrarily control the strain. Here we show that by creating atomically-flat surface nanostructures in hexagonal boron nitride, we achieve an arbitrary on-chip control of both the strain distribution and magnitude on high-quality molybdenum disulfide.", "target": "The phonon and exciton emissions are shown to vary in accordance with our strain field designs, enabling us to write and draw any photoluminescence color image in a single chip. Moreover, our strain engineering offers a powerful means to significantly and controllably alter the strengths and energies of interlayer excitons at room temperature."}
{"background": "Compositionally complex materials have demonstrated extraordinary promise for structural robustness in extreme environments. Of these, the most commonly thought of are high entropy alloys, where chemical complexity grants uncommon combinations of hardness, ductility, and thermal resilience. In contrast to these metal-metal bonded systems, the addition of ionic and covalent bonding has led to the discovery of high entropy ceramics. These materials also possess outstanding structural, thermal, and chemical robustness but with a far greater variety of functional properties which enable access to continuously controllable magnetic, electronic, and optical phenomena. In this perspective, we outline the potential for high entropy ceramics in functional applications under extreme environments, where intrinsic stability may provide a new path toward inherently hardened device design.", "target": "Current works on high entropy carbides, actinide bearing ceramics, and high entropy oxides are reviewed in the areas of radiation, high temperature, and corrosion tolerance where the role of local disorder is shown to create pathways toward self-healing and structural robustness."}
