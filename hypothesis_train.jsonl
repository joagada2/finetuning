{"background": "The paper presents the results of research on microstructure and impact strength of AlSi13Cu2 matrix composite reinforced by Ni-coating carbon fibers (C F ) with a volume fraction of 5%, 10% and 15%. As part of the study, fiber distribution in aluminum matrix was evaluated and variation in impact strength of composite as a function of the carbon fibers volume fraction and pressure applied were determined.", "target": "The composite suspensions were prepared using by stirring method and subsequently squeeze casted under different pressures of 25, 50, 75 and 100 MPa. It has been found that the presence of Ni coating on carbon fibers clearly improves their wettability by liquid aluminum alloy and in combination with the stirring parameters applied, composite material with relatively homogeneous structure can be produced. Charpy's test showed that the impact strength of composite reaches the highest value by carrying out the squeeze casting process at 75 MPa. In the next stage of research, it was found that the impact strength of composites increases with the increase of carbon fibers volume fraction and for 15% of fibers is close to 8 J/cm 2. Observations of fracture surfaces have revealed that crack growth in the composites propagates with a quasi-cleavage mechanism. During the creation of the fracture, all fibers arranged perpendicular to its surface were sheared. At the same time, the metal matrix around the fibers deformed plastically creating characteristic ductile breaks. The fracture surface formation through the fibers indicates a cohesive and strong connection of the reinforcement with the matrix. In addition to the phenomena mentioned, debonding the fiber-matrix interfaces and the formation of voids between components were observed on the fracture surface."}

The first group was normalized, the second group was normalized and subsequently subjected to cryogenic treatment then tempered at (200 \u00b0C) for one hour, the third group was quenched from intercritical annealing temperature of (760 \u00b0C) to obtain dual phase (DP) steel, the fourth and fifth groups were both quenched from (760 \u00b0C), but the forth group was subjected to cryogenic treatment and the fifth group was subjected to cryogenic then tempered at (200 \u00b0C) for one hour.

The yield and tensile strength (\u03c3y, \u03c3u) of (DP) for the three steels, were higher than those of normalized condition, and increased after cryogenic treatment. These values, for the three steel grades, decreased after tempering at temperature 200\u00b0C. Tempering of (DP) steel at 200\u00b0C for one hour, after cryogenic treatment, causes the reappearance of yielding point for steels (C12D) and (C32D) while no such a change noticed in (C42D) steel.

Immersion and electrochemical tests of samples were also carried out in Ringer\u2019s solution at 37\u00b0C. The results of immersion and electrochemical tests indicated lower corrosion resistance of the substrate as compared with coated samples. The hydrogen evolution rate of the substrate increased with the immersion time. For coated samples, the hydrogen evolution rate was more stable. The ZnN coating (based on Zn(NO3)2) provides better corrosion protection because the corrosion product layer was uniform, while the sample with a CaN coating (based on Ca(NO3)2) displayed clusters of corrosion products. It was found that pitting corrosion on the substrate led to the complete disintegration and non-uniform corrosion of the coated samples, especially the CaN sample, due to the unevenly-distributed products on its surface."}

The experiments showed a significant effect of droplet size on the percent area coverage of the sprayed surfaces. A high value of the vertical transverse approach surface coverage results from coarse droplets, high driving speed, and nozzles angled forward. Increasing the vertical transverse leaving surface coverage, as well as the coverage of the sum of all sprayed surfaces, requires fine droplets, low driving speed, and nozzles angled backwards. The maximum coverage of the upper level surface is obtained with coarse droplets, low driving speed, and a spray angle perpendicular to the direction of movement. Higher upper level surface coverage is obtained when single flat fan nozzles are used, while twin nozzles produce better coverage of vertical surfaces."}

Based on a theoretical analysis of a differential change of CO mass concentration and the CO dispersion model in a fixed site, this paper presents several blasting fume monitoring test experiments, carried out with the test location to the head L P in arrange of 40-140 m.", "target": "Studies have been done by arranging multiple sensors in the arch cross-section of the blind gallery, located at the Guilaizhuang Gold Mine, Shandong Province, China. The findings indicate that CO concentrations in the axial directions are quadratic functions with the Y and Z coordinate values of the cross-section of the blind gallery in an ascending stage of CO time- -concentration curve, with the maximum CO concentrations in Y = 150 cm and Z = 150 cm. Also, the gradients of CO concentration in the gallery are symmetrical with the Y = 150 cm and Z = 150 cm. In the descending stage of CO time-concentration curve, gradients of CO concentration decrease in lateral sides and increase in the middle, then gradually decrease at last. The rules of CO concentration distribution in the cross-section are that airflow triggers the turbulent change of the CO distribution volume concentration and make the CO volume concentration even gradually in the fixed position of the gallery. Moreover, the CO volume concentrations decrease gradually, as well as volume concentration gradients in the cross-section. The uniformity coefficients of CO concentration with duct airflow velocities of 12.5 m/s, 17.7 m/s and 23.2 m/s reach near 0.9 at 100-140 m from the heading to the monitoring spot. The theoretical model of a one-dimensional migration law of CO basically coincides with the negative exponential decay, which is verified via fitting. The average effective turbulent diffusion coefficient of CO in the blind gallery is approximate to 0.108 m 2 /s. There are strong linear relationships between CO initial concentration, CO peak concentrations and mass of explosive agent, which indicates that the CO initial concentration and the CO peak concentration can be predicted, based on the given range of the charging mass."}

{"background": "Fixed bed sorption processes such as adsorption and ion exchange do not operate at steady state. The design equations are differential that usually require numerical methods to solve. Thomas gives a general analytical solution for these equations. It is based on second-order reaction kinetics and the assumption of Langmuir isotherm. Four sets of experimental data are tested to show the capability of Thomas model to predict the breakthrough curves for adsorption and ion exchange processes.", "target": "Computer program for the solution of Thomas model was designed using MATLAB 7.0. These data represent the sorption of o-cresol from water by activated carbon, acetic acid from air by activated carbon, phenol from water by natural zeolite, and trichloroethylene from air by zeolite-5A. The results show that there are a good agreement between the experimental data and the model."}
{"background": "Determining the boundary conditions of heat transfer in steel manufacturing is a very important issue. The heat transfer effect during contact of two solid bodies occurs in the continuous casting steel process. The temperature fields of solids taking part in heat transfer are described by the Fourier equation. The boundary conditions of heat transfer must be determined to get an accurate solution to the heat conduction equation. The heat flux between the tool and the object processed depends mainly on temperature, pressure and time. It is very difficult and complicated to accomplish direct identification and determination of the boundary conditions in this process. The solution to this problem may be the construction of a process model, performing measurements at a test stand, and using numerical methods. The proposed model must be verified on the basis of parameters which can easily be measured in industrial processes. One of them is temperature, which may be used in inverse methods to determine the heat transfer coefficient. This work presents the methodology for determining the heat flux between two solid bodies staying in contact.", "target": "It consists of two stages \u2013 the experiment and the numerical computation. The problem was solved by using the finite element method (FEM) and a numerical program developed at AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow. The findings of the conducted research are relationships describing the value of the heat flux versus the contact time and surface temperature."}
{"background": "Recently, the use of inorganic binders cured by heat as a progressive technology for large scale production of cores is widely discussed topic in aluminium foundries. As practical experiences show, knock-out properties of inorganic binders were significantly increased, although they cannot overcome organic based binder systems. Theory of geopolymer binder states, that binder bridge destruction is mainly of adhesive character. The main aim of this research paper was to examine binder bridge destruction of alkali silicate and geopolymer binder systems.", "target": "In order to fulfil this objective, sample parts were submitted to defined thermal load, broken and by using SEM analysis, binder bridge destruction mechanism was observed. Results showed that geopolymer binder system examined within this investigation does not have mainly adhesive destruction of binder bridges, however the ratio of adhesive-cohesive to cohesive destruction is higher than by use of alkali silicate based binder systems, therefore better knock-out properties can be expected."}
{"background": "The present paper describe the issue of tool materials wear in a high temperature conditions. The investigations aim was to determine the role of microstructure in a tribological properties between the structural steel and tool material.", "target": "The investigations were performed at the cast steel tool material at the tribological contact to the structural steel. The observations of the wear mechanisms were referred to the microstructure of the mill rolls. The laboratory tests ware aimed at evaluating the thermal treatment modification effect on the cast steels properties. A significant role of the morphology of ledeburitic cementite and secondary cementite on the tribological properties was exhibited. The investigations assumed the presence of an austenitic matrix with primary and secondary cementite. Influence of varying morphology carbides was described."}
{"background": "The aim of this study is to investigate influence of selected parameters of gas tungsten arc welding on microstructure of MAR-M247 nickel based superalloy originating from turbine vane. MAR-M247 is a precipitation-strengthened superalloy which is widely used in aerospace engines. The main strengthening phase in this material is ordered L12 intermetallic \u03b3' phase Ni3(Al, Ti).", "target": "The surface of alloy was modified by electric arc in order to present microstructural changes in weld and heat affected zone. Investigation of the heat affected zone revealed that constitutional liquation of \u03b3' particles and primary carbides is responsible for the formation of a liquid grain boundary layer which finally contributed to cracking. Scanning electron microscopy indicated high susceptibility to cracking of MAR-M247 alloy which is connected with high content of \u03b3'-formers aluminum and titanium."}

The impact of rain, temperatures, conductivity, dissolved oxygen content on corrosion rate were characterized. The corrosivity of different water sources like mountain water, underground water or river water were indicated. The possible actions for reducing corrosion losses were characterized. Results show that pollution of the environment in the form of acid rain and runoff from agriculture as well as the type of the source water has significant influence on corrosion of water distribution system."}
{"background": "Blast mitigation continues to be a popular field of research when military vehicles are concerned. The main problem is coping with the vehicle global motion consequences following an explosion. The paper presents a potential application of the linear vacuum packed particle (VPP) damper as a supplementation for a viscous shock absorber in a traditional blast mitigation seat design. The paper also presents field test results for the underbelly blast explosion, comparing them to the laboratory tests carried out on the impact bench.", "target": "To collect accelerations, the anthropomorphic test device, i.e. the Hybrid III dummy, was used. A set of numerical simulations of the modified blast mitigation seat with the additional VPP linear damper were revealed. The VPP damper was modeled according to the Johnson\u2013Cook model of viscoplasticity. The Hertzian contact theory was adopted to model the contact between the vehicle and the ground. The reduction of the dynamic response index (DRI) in the case of the VPP damper application was also proved."}
